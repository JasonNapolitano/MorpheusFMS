>**IMPORTANT NOTE:** THIS REPO IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND WILL BE UPDATED HOPEFULLY ON A DAILY BASIS. I WILL TRY MY BEST TO KEEP THIS REPO UP DAILY GIVEN THAT I WORK AN AVERAGE OF 10-12 HOURS A DAY IN THE HEAT OF SOUTHERN CALIFRONIA :-P. ALSO, THE APPLICATIONS ACTUAL FILES WILL BE UPLOADED AFTER THE INITIAL README.MD FILE IS COMPLETE AND THE PRODUCTION BUILD IS READY. AS OF TODAY, THERE IS NO OFFICIAL TIMELINE FOR THAT, I APOLOGIZE FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.

### Morpheus File Management System - AKA: MorpheusFMS (Lite/Free Version)

**QUICK NOTE:** This is the Lite version. While still offering tons of amazing functionality, the Pro version on CodeCanyon will have an assortment of amazing features added to it.Such as theme selection, user management, permissions management, module Support and so much more. Also note, the Pro version will be uploaded to CodeCanyon as soon as this Lite version is in production mode and a link to the Pro version will be embedded in this README once available.

**A brief introduction to MorpheuFMS**

 You may be asking yourself: What exactly is MorpheusFMS, what does it do, who is it for, what are its requirements and what powers it? These are great questions that this README file will help you to understand the power of MorpheusFMS. For further documentation, visit the ./support directory. All docs are writted in Markdown format.

 Morpheus FMS is a simple, yet powerful web server file manager operating under the Morpheus PHP Backbone, the very framework that every other Morpheus apps are going to be built on. Simply put, this is just the beginning of the Morpheus Web Aplication Lineup. MorpheusFMS utilizes up-to-date server/client side programming and languages. Written in PSR Compliant OOP|MVC|PHP, W3C Validated HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. Included are some amazing frameworks, plugins, libraries and more. With the power of these integrated tools, dedication, commitment, hard work and the love that was put into this application, MorpheusFMS will allow to you to easily navigate through, create, read, update and delete files and/or directories on your web server. Along with all this, MorpheusFMS would not be possible without the ability, and availability to usie some amazing open-source frameworks, libraries and more. All the developers of those plugins, frameworks and libraries deserve all the credit (READ MORE COMING SOON).

 Oh yeah, the default MorphuesFMS working directory is whichever directory you install it into on your web server.Of course, the default MorphuesFMS working directory, can be changed at *any time* by simply opening the fantastic, simple to locate & use settings window by cliking a button, and typing the name of the default MorphuesFMS working directory into the required field and saving it. Also, it can be virtually any directory on your web server that you desire.

 Now, that the brief introduction to MorpheusFMS has been completed, and you have a better understanding of its core features it is time to break the MorpheusFMS key concepts and key components down into individual subjects, making the learning and understanding proccess much more detailed, while including some great screenshots of MorpheusFMS to give you a visual representation of the application (a YouTube video is in development as well, which gives a virtual toutr of the apoplication. It will be added here shortly as well in the near future). So, don't fear, it really is not very hard to break MorpheusFMS's components, requirements, plugins used, and core fundamentals before using it. 

**So, how does it work?**

 Morpheus uses specific frameworks, libraries, and useful plugins / tools to bring you a fast, lightweight, secure, powerful, customizable and robust Web Server file and directory manager. Morpheus allows you to easily navigate throughout your directories on your web server & edit the files within the directories (with support for 83 programming languages ( View List ).
 
 **What Powers Morpheus?**
 
 MorpheusFMS is powered by some amazin frameworks, libraries and plugins, allowing for a robust, secure, ultra lightweight File Management Platform. The key frameworks and libraries are:
 
  - **The Morpheus PHP Backbone/Framework:** Powered by Codeigniter 3, Morpheus' Backbone is the heart and soul of all Morpheus applications. Using the CodeIgniter 3 Framework, it uses proper MVC Structuring (HMVC in certain Morpheus Applications), as well, it follows all applicable PSR Standards (EG - PSR - 1, 2, 4 [When using Composer], & 7, ). As well as being the core of the Morpheus built Applications, it also ensures proper web security principles are used, uses the MY_Model/MY_Controller, for easier global modifications and database interactions. The list of what is put into the modified version of CodeIgniter is practically endless, but it is an absolutely amazing revision that doeas everything needed for robust, strong and powerful web applications.
  - **More coming soon:** This repo is coming soon and this README is still under heavy construction. For now, I am just going to continue the README while i Finish the Production version of the application. The i will upload it to the repository for all to try and see!
